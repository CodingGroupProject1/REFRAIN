# Refrain Readme
Refrain is a responsive website where one can view the weather in their current location, match their mood to the weather and listen to the associated playlist. From varying emotions, we selected the four of the most common: Happy, fear, sad and surprise and integrated it to the Deezer API for music selection. If a playlist is unavailable, the user can search for the artist/playlist/song and will be redirected to Deezer for selection. Additionally, we created a mood map option through journaling and accessibility to resources for mental health literature and facilities.
